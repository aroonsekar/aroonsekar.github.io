                            <p>For the Advanced Practice Semester, worked on a project with ‚ÄúNorthumbrian Water Ltd (NWL)‚Äù to explore the viability of simulations on virtual city models to 
                                estimate the impact of floods in water systems operations. Used Unreal Engine to simulate a flood situation in the Newcastle Quayside area and developed  
                                a game concept for better understanding of environmental risks. This project also involves in project management which requires exceptional leadership,  
                                organisational, team-coordination, time management, presentation and communication skills. </p>

                            <p>As a part of the assessment for the module ‚ÄúObject Oriented Programming‚Äù, developed a SUDOKU game from the partial code provided. The game was developed
                                  with the Object-Oriented Programming concepts in JAVA. The Game has both Text-based UI and a Graphical UI. Designed the Graphical UI in Figma 
                                 and developed in JAVA using Swing API. The assessment also included various testing methods that are used for debugging.
                                 The project underscores the skills in software development lifecycle management and problem-solving within both theoretical and real-world contexts.</p>
